This is the simple shell project as attempted by Eke Chinwendu & Ighalo Augustine.
This simple shell tests the problem solving skills learnt so far during the course of this program and also stretches our understanding of the fundamental concepts as regards programming. This README will be updated t the end of the project as we go along and create new files.
